					Fitness has changed drastically over the last few decades, and <strong>Fitness
						World </strong>has evolved with it. Countless fads have come and gone, but
					Life Fitness has endured to encourage people to lead active
					lives.Our mission at <strong>Fitness World</strong> is to develop
					the fitness solutions that get the world moving. And we feel that
					it’s extremely important to practice what we preach. The culture at
					<strong>Fitness World </strong>revolves around what our products
					stand for—active and healthy living. Gym bags are as common as
					coffee mugs at our global headquarters outside of Chicago and at
					our nine other offices worldwide. Our product showrooms double as
					bustling employee gyms, and lively group workouts are an important
					part of the daily routine.

				<p style="text-align: justify;">
					<strong>Fitness World</strong> innovation begins with product
					design and conception and doesn't end until our fitness equipment
					ships out of the warehouse. It's essential to creating the best
					fitness equipment in the industry.
				</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">
					The top fitness clubs around the world rely on <strong>Fitness
						World</strong> to provide the best fitness equipment in the industry. But
					we're not just found in clubs. It’s a safe bet that your favorite
					baseball, football or basketball team uses our strength and cardio
					equipment to train. We’re trusted by the pros in every sport. And,
					big-time college athletic programs use Fitness World to get ready
					for game day. Our equipment provides memorable stays for guests at
					the world’s largest hotel chains and small boutique hotels. And it
					ensures that police, fire and military personnel are ready for
